# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Allyship Global Ltd website is built using a modern, component-based architecture with Next.js at its core. This document outlines the key architectural decisions and patterns used throughout the project.

## Core Technologies

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 15.1.7**
  - Server-side rendering for optimal performance
  - Static site generation for blog posts
  - App Router for modern routing capabilities

### State Management
- React's built-in hooks for local state
- Server components for data fetching
- Client components for interactive features

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**
  - Utility-first approach
  - Custom theme configuration
  - Responsive design system

### Animation
- **Framer Motion**
  - Page transitions
  - Component animations
  - Scroll-based effects

## Component Architecture

### Atomic Design Pattern
```
components/
├── common/          # Shared components (buttons, icons)
├── layout/          # Layout components (header, footer)
├── sections/        # Page sections (hero, features)
└── blog/            # Blog-specific components
```

### Component Guidelines
- Prefer functional components
